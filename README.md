### What is Stronghands?
[StrongHands](https://stronghands.info) (abbreviated SHND) is a [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) openly forked  using [proof-of-stake consensus](https://peercoin.net/resources.html#whitepaper) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](https://peercoin.net/resources.html#whitepaper)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Stronghands is based on [Peercoin](https://peercoin.net) which  is based on [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), while incorporating many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.

Stronghands was originally released in 2015, it's initial POS return model of 100% /month resulted in incredible coin supply over time.
* In 2018 it was modified to adjust returns to reduce issuance.
* In 2019 it was moved to this new chain with a new reduced supply, and new return model.
* In 2021 it was updated with new logo.



With much love and respect to Peercoin.
