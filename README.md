## What is StrongHands?
[StrongHands](https://stronghands.info) (abbreviated SHND) is a [cryptocurrency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) openly forked  using [proof-of-stake consensus](https://peercoin.net/resources.html#whitepaper) as a security model, with a combined [proof-of-stake](https://peercoin.net/resources.html#whitepaper)/[proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) minting system. Stronghands is based on [Peercoin](https://peercoin.net) which  is based on [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org), while incorporating many important innovations to cryptocurrency field including new security model, energy efficiency, better minting model and more adaptive response to rapid change in network computation power.

#### StrongHands (SHND) was originally [released in 2015](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1195510.0), its initial POS return model of 100% /month resulted in incredible coin supply over time.

#### Here is a short story

* In 2017 a community decided by a takeover and end the hyperstaking configuration, check [Bitcointalk Announcement](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2709780)
* In 2018 it was modified to adjust returns to reduce issuance through a hard fork
* In 2019 it was moved to this new chain with a new reduced supply, and new return model.


With much love and respect to Peercoin.
